ðŸ“¦ Direct Handling SPLUNK Dashboard
This repository includes all the source code, logic, and workbook structures used to build an interactive Excel-based dashboard for tracking and analyzing direct outbound scans from a central hub, with drill-down capabilities to individual scans and parcel allocations.

ðŸ§° Components
The code and Excel logic together enable:

Aggregated and section-wise consignment scan tracking

Dynamic filtering and comparison between current and historical data

Identification of parcel scan locations and final allocations

Charts and macro-powered visual summaries

All components are structured within the .xlsm file and include multiple detailed sheets (e.g., Summary, DetailAS, Missorts, Conveyable) along with supporting lookup and visualization logic.

ðŸ”’ Note:
The interactive dashboard relies on internal links and macros hosted on the company's network. Due to network restrictions, it cannot be rendered or shared externally.
